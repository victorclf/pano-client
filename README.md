Pano is a demo of a social news app written with TS, React, Redux (+ RTK Query) and MUI.

Currently, the backend is a mock built with MSW, so the data is local and only lasts until the app is refreshed. Moreover, the response delays are artificial.

Features:
- Voting (up, down, unvote)
- Posts (infinite scroll listing, create and view)
- Comments (create, edit and view)
- Users (view)
- Auth (log in and out)
